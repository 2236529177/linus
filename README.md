== Linus

Linus is a web application for managing the steps of the publication process, from story brainstorming to copy-editing to publishing.

There are several available editor roles in Linus, each with their own set of permissions and capabilities:
       * Editor in Chief, :chief - Read/write access to everything on
         the site. This person or group of people are the big kahunas. 
       * Managing Editor, :managing - Read access to parts of the site
         related to editorial choices (i.e. assignments, submissions, etc.),
         write access to parts of the site related to administration of the
         publication (i.e. deadlines, finances, etc.) 
       * Copy Editor, :copy - Write access to submissions without the
         ability to accept changes. Read access everywhere else.
       * Layout Editor, :layout - Read access to everything
       * Secretary, :secretary - Write access to ideas and
         assignments, read access to everything else except submissions
       * Web Editor, :web - Read access to articles. 
       * Writer, :writer - ???

 The ability to add arbitrary roles will be considered in the future.
