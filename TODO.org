* Tasks: Linus
** Submissions
*** DONE writers for submissions
*** TODO multiple writers for submissions?
*** TODO the ability to add a new writer from the submission page
*** TODO add an "add submission" page for writers to make submissions
*** TODO add a notion of status to submissions
    A submission with a status of "published" or something similar
    should in essence become an "article". Pubilshed submissions
    should require association with an issue.
    
    It might be useful to have other available statuses. Should we
    track submissions through the entire process? That is, new,
    editing, copy_editing, etc.? Or would it be better to leave these
    sort of statuses to be a part of the Issue model?
    
** Issues
*** TODO Potentially add status to Issues... see comment in submissions for details
*** DONE add basic scaffolding for issues
    
** Miscellaneous 
*** TODO Gemify hallo.js
